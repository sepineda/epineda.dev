As a Software Developer, one of the most common endeavors is to keep up with the latest technologies, like frameworks, libraries, servers, programming languages and others. To be honest, reading books is not a practical way to keep up with the dizzying speed of evolution in Software technologies. Books are more useful when it comes to learning about foundations than learning bleeding edge technologies, the building blocks of knowledge.

We could acquire some of these bases from academia, but often they skip some critical topics, those we have to complement by ourselves because in the end we should never stop reading, studying, doing, or in other words: learning.

This is not by any means a closed and ultimate list, I’m sure several titles are missing, so please, don’t hesitate to add your suggestions in the comments below or in the social channels.
Without any more delays, let’s begin!.

## Books about Software Design
